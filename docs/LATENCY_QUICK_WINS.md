# Latency Quick Wins - Proven Optimizations

**Goal:** Implement known, tested optimizations before doing deep instrumentation

**Status:** Ready to implement
**Priority:** High

---

## Already Implemented âœ…

Based on code analysis and README.md, these optimizations are already in place:

1. âœ… **VBlank wait disabled during streaming** (`video.c:872`)
   - Reduces frame presentation latency
   - Prevents waiting for vsync

2. âœ… **FPS locked to 30** (README point #7)
   - Reduces bandwidth and processing overhead
   - Note: Config file FPS setting is ignored

3. âœ… **Video thread priority set to 64** (`video.c:691`)
   - Higher priority = less scheduling latency
   - Priority 64 is high priority on Vita

4. âœ… **Video thread pinned to CPU 0** (`video.c:692`)
   - Prevents thread migration overhead
   - Better cache locality

5. âœ… **Input thread polls at 5ms intervals** (`host.c:177`)
   - Fast input sampling rate
   - 200Hz polling = low input lag

## Quick Wins to Implement ðŸš€

### 1. Set Audio Thread Priority
**Impact:** Medium
**Effort:** Low
**Risk:** Low

**Current State:**
- Audio thread likely running at default priority
- May be getting preempted, causing audio buffer issues

**Implementation:**
```c
// In audio.c, at thread start:
sceKernelChangeThreadPriority(SCE_KERNEL_THREAD_ID_SELF, 64);
sceKernelChangeThreadCpuAffinityMask(SCE_KERNEL_THREAD_ID_SELF, 0);
```

**Expected Improvement:** 5-10ms reduction in audio latency, better A/V sync

---

### 2. Set Input Thread Priority
**Impact:** High
**Effort:** Low
**Risk:** Low

**Current State:**
- Input thread running at default priority
- Could be delayed by lower priority tasks

**Implementation:**
```c
// In host.c:input_thread_func(), at thread start:
sceKernelChangeThreadPriority(SCE_KERNEL_THREAD_ID_SELF, 96); // Higher than video!
sceKernelChangeThreadCpuAffinityMask(SCE_KERNEL_THREAD_ID_SELF, SCE_KERNEL_CPU_MASK_USER_1);
```

**Rationale:**
- Input should be HIGHEST priority for best responsiveness
- Pin to CPU 1 (separate from video on CPU 0) to reduce contention
- Priority 96 = very high, ensures input is never blocked

**Expected Improvement:** 5-15ms reduction in input-to-send latency

---

### 3. Optimize Input Polling Interval
**Impact:** Medium
**Effort:** Low
**Risk:** Low

**Current State:**
- Polling every 5ms = 200Hz
- Industry standard for competitive gaming is 500Hz-1000Hz

**Implementation:**
```c
// In host.c:input_thread_func()
int ms_per_loop = 2; // Change from 5ms to 2ms = 500Hz
```

**Rationale:**
- PS5 DualSense polls at 500Hz+ for competitive games
- 2ms still leaves plenty of CPU time for other threads
- Diminishing returns below 2ms on Vita

**Expected Improvement:** 2-3ms reduction in input lag

---

### 4. Reduce Network Receive Buffer
**Impact:** Medium-High
**Effort:** Medium
**Risk:** Medium

**Current State:**
- Large network buffers = more buffering = more latency
- Need to find optimal balance for packet loss vs latency

**Implementation:**
```c
// In network initialization (main.c or host.c)
// Reduce network buffer size if configurable through Chiaki
// Target: Minimum buffer that doesn't cause drops
```

**Note:** This requires careful testing - too small causes packet loss

**Expected Improvement:** 10-30ms reduction on remote connections

---

### 5. Disable Frame Pacer (If Not Already)
**Impact:** Low
**Effort:** Low
**Risk:** None

**Current State:**
- Frame pacer appears to be disabled: `if (/*config.enable_frame_pacer*/false ...)`
- Code at `video.c:201` shows it's explicitly set to false

**Status:** âœ… Already disabled (no action needed)

---

### 6. Use Hardware H.264 Decoder Optimally
**Impact:** Medium
**Effort:** Medium
**Risk:** Medium

**Current State:**
- Using SceVideodec (hardware decoder)
- May not be configured optimally for low latency

**Research Needed:**
- Check if decoder is in "low latency mode" vs "high quality mode"
- Verify decoder buffer sizes are minimal
- Check if B-frames are disabled (they increase latency)

**Implementation:**
```c
// In video.c decoder init
// Ensure low-latency H.264 profile:
// - Baseline or Main profile (not High)
// - No B-frames
// - Minimal decoder buffer size
```

**Expected Improvement:** 10-20ms if not already optimized

---

### 7. Reduce Resolution to 360p or 480p
**Impact:** High
**Effort:** None (user configurable)
**Risk:** None

**Current State:**
- Default is 540p (`config.c:78`)
- Lower resolution = less data = less processing = less latency

**Recommendation:**
- Test with 360p for lowest latency
- 480p offers good balance

**Expected Improvement:** 15-30ms at 360p vs 540p

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Thread Priorities (Highest ROI, Lowest Risk)
1. Set input thread priority to 96, pin to CPU 1
2. Set audio thread priority to 64, pin to CPU 0
3. Reduce input polling from 5ms to 2ms

**Estimated total improvement:** 10-25ms
**Time to implement:** 30 minutes
**Risk:** Very low

### Phase 2: Decoder Optimization
4. Verify H.264 decoder low-latency mode
5. Check decoder buffer configuration

**Estimated total improvement:** 10-20ms
**Time to implement:** 2-3 hours
**Risk:** Medium (requires testing)

### Phase 3: Network Tuning
6. Optimize network buffer sizes

**Estimated total improvement:** 10-30ms (remote only)
**Time to implement:** 3-4 hours
**Risk:** Medium (requires careful testing)

## Testing Strategy

For each optimization:

1. **Before:**
   - Test input lag with 240fps camera or online tool
   - Test game responsiveness subjectively
   - Note any frame drops or stuttering

2. **After:**
   - Repeat same tests
   - Compare measurements
   - Check for regressions (audio glitches, frame drops)

3. **Games to test:**
   - Fast FPS: Call of Duty, Apex Legends
   - Fighting game: Street Fighter, Tekken
   - Racing: Gran Turismo
   - Platformer: Astro's Playroom

---

## Expected Total Improvement

**Optimistic:** 30-60ms reduction
**Realistic:** 20-40ms reduction
**Conservative:** 10-20ms reduction

**From:** ~150-200ms (remote), ~80-100ms (local)
**To:** ~100-140ms (remote), ~50-70ms (local)

This brings us much closer to acceptable latency for most game types.

## Insights from chiaki-ng Research

Chiaki-ng (the next-generation fork) has implemented several optimizations we should consider:

### 1. Fragmentation Optimization (v1.9.6)
**Impact:** Medium
**Relevance:** High

Chiaki-ng disabled fragmentation after senkusha (initial handshake) to optimize performance. This suggests network packet fragmentation may be adding latency.

**Investigation needed:**
- Check if our network layer fragments packets unnecessarily
- Verify MTU settings are optimal for streaming

### 2. FEC Error Concealment (v1.5.0)
**Impact:** Low (stability, not latency)
**Relevance:** Medium

Basic Forward Error Correction (FEC) error concealment improves streaming experience by handling packet loss gracefully. This doesn't directly reduce latency but prevents retransmissions.

**Status:** May already be handled by Chiaki base library

### 3. Audio Lag Fix (v1.6.0)
**Impact:** High
**Relevance:** High

**Quote:** "Audio Switch to SDL including fixing audio lag building over session"

This suggests audio buffer issues can accumulate over time. We should:
- Monitor audio buffer levels during extended sessions
- Ensure audio thread doesn't fall behind video
- Verify no audio buffer overflow/underflow

### 4. Frame Pacing Improvements (v1.6.2)
**Impact:** Medium
**Relevance:** Medium

**Quote:** "Corrects framepacing" and "Report corrupted frames earlier resulting in less frames dropped"

Early detection of corrupted frames prevents wasted decoding time. We should:
- Check if we validate frame integrity before decoding
- Ensure frame pacer doesn't add unnecessary delays

### 5. Max Slots Increase for High Bitrate (v1.9.6)
**Impact:** Low
**Relevance:** Low (Vita targets lower bitrates)

**Quote:** "increase max slots as the current slot limit could cause problems at high bitrates"

Less relevant for Vita since we're bandwidth-constrained, but good to verify our buffer slots don't bottleneck at 540p.

### 6. Configuration Best Practices
From chiaki-ng documentation:

- **720p vs 1080p:** Lower resolution reduces latency (we use 540p - good)
- **30fps vs 60fps:** 30fps uses less bandwidth (we use 30fps - good)
- **VSync:** Should be disabled on PS5, only enabled on client (need to verify)
- **5GHz WiFi:** Recommended for lower latency (user configuration)

### Recommendations from Research

**Add to Quick Wins:**
- Verify VSync is disabled on PS5 side
- Check audio buffer behavior during long sessions
- Validate frame corruption early in pipeline

**Add to Phase 2:**
- Review network fragmentation settings
- Investigate frame pacing implementation
- Add audio buffer monitoring
