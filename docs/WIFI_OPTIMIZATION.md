# WiFi Optimization Guide for VitaRPS5

**Goal:** Minimize network latency for best streaming experience

**Target Improvement:** 10-30ms latency reduction through proper WiFi configuration

---

## PS Vita WiFi Limitations

The PS Vita has inherent WiFi limitations you should be aware of:

- **Standard:** 802.11b/g/n (n = 1x1) - Single antenna, no MIMO
- **Max Speed:** ~3-4 Mbps in typical conditions (even close to router)
- **Known Issues:** Latency can spike to 700ms in poor network environments
- **Year:** 2011 technology - 14 years old as of 2025

These hardware limitations are why local network optimization is critical.

## Critical PS Vita Settings

### 1. Disable WiFi Power Save Mode ⚠️ MOST IMPORTANT

**Impact:** Can reduce latency by 50-100ms!

**How to disable:**
1. Go to **Settings** (not WiFi settings!)
2. Navigate to **Power Save Settings**
3. Find **"Use Wi-Fi in Power Save Mode"**
4. Turn it **OFF**

**Why it matters:**
Power save mode causes the WiFi chip to sleep between packets, adding massive latency spikes.

---

### 2. Select Optimal WiFi Channel

**Impact:** 5-20ms improvement in congested environments

**How to configure:**
1. Open **Settings** > **Network**
2. Go to your WiFi connection
3. **Advanced Settings**
4. Change channel if auto-selection picks a congested one

**Recommendations:**
- **Channels 1, 6, or 11** (non-overlapping in 2.4GHz)
- Use WiFi analyzer app on phone to check congestion
- Avoid channels with 10+ other networks

---

## Router Configuration

### 1. Security Mode: WPA2-AES Only

**Impact:** 10-30ms latency improvement

**Configuration:**
- Set security to **WPA2-AES** (also called WPA2-CCMP)
- **Disable TKIP** completely
- **No mixed mode** (WPA/WPA2)

**Why it matters:**
TKIP adds encryption overhead and the Vita's WiFi chip handles it poorly.

---

### 2. Use 5GHz WiFi (If Supported by Router)

**⚠️ WARNING:** PS Vita **ONLY supports 2.4GHz WiFi**

While you cannot use 5GHz on Vita, you CAN:
1. Move other devices to 5GHz
2. Reduce 2.4GHz congestion
3. Give Vita cleaner 2.4GHz spectrum

**Recommended Setup:**
- PS5: 5GHz WiFi or Ethernet (best)
- Vita: 2.4GHz WiFi
- Other devices: 5GHz WiFi

---

### 3. Router Quality of Service (QoS)

**Impact:** 5-15ms in busy networks

**Configuration:**
- Enable QoS in router settings
- Set **Gaming** or **Video Streaming** as highest priority
- Alternatively, prioritize Vita's MAC address

**How to find Vita MAC address:**
1. **Settings** > **System** > **System Information**
2. Note the MAC address
3. Add to router's QoS priority list

---

### 4. Reduce WiFi Interference

**Impact:** 10-50ms in congested environments

**Best Practices:**
- **Move closer to router** - Even 2-3 meters helps significantly
- **Remove obstacles** - Walls, microwaves, cordless phones interfere
- **Change router location** - Elevate it, move to central location
- **Turn off 2.4GHz devices** - Bluetooth, wireless keyboards, baby monitors

---

## Advanced: PS5 Configuration

### Use Wired Connection for PS5

**Impact:** 20-40ms improvement!

**Why it matters:**
Your total latency = Vita WiFi latency + PS5 WiFi latency + Network

By using **Ethernet on PS5**, you remove one WiFi hop:
- Before: Vita (WiFi) ← Router (WiFi) → PS5
- After: Vita (WiFi) ← Router (Ethernet) → PS5

**This is the single biggest improvement you can make!**

---

### PS5 Remote Play Settings

1. Go to **Settings** > **System** > **Remote Play**
2. **Video Quality:** Set to **Standard** (not High)
3. **Frame Rate:** Locked to 30 FPS (cannot change)
4. **Resolution:** 540p default (good for Vita screen)

**Note:** VitaRPS5 overrides some settings for optimal Vita performance.

---

## Network Setup Comparison

| Setup | Expected Latency | Recommended |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Vita WiFi ← Router WiFi → PS5 WiFi** | 80-120ms | ❌ Worst |
| **Vita WiFi ← Router → PS5 Ethernet** | 50-80ms | ✅ Good |
| **Vita close to router + PS5 Ethernet + Optimized** | 40-60ms | ✅✅ Best achievable |

---

## Testing Your Latency

### In-Game Test
1. Play a rhythm game (like Beat Saber)
2. Note if timing feels off
3. Test with wired controller on PS5 for comparison

### Visual Test
1. Wave controller rapidly side-to-side
2. Watch on-screen cursor movement
3. Latency = delay between physical motion and screen update

**Target Feel:**
- **<50ms:** Feels responsive, playable for most games
- **50-80ms:** Noticeable but acceptable
- **>100ms:** Frustrating for fast-paced games

---

## Troubleshooting High Latency

### If latency is still >100ms after optimizations:

1. **Check WiFi Power Save** - This is #1 cause of high latency
2. **Verify router security** - Must be WPA2-AES only
3. **Test WiFi speed** - Run Vita browser speed test
4. **Check channel congestion** - Use WiFi analyzer app
5. **Move closer to router** - Test 2-3 meters away
6. **Restart router** - Fixes temporary issues
7. **Update router firmware** - Newer firmware often improves WiFi

### If nothing helps:

Your WiFi environment may be too congested or router too old. Consider:
- **WiFi range extender** placed between router and Vita
- **Router upgrade** to newer model with better 2.4GHz performance
- **Powerline adapter** to move router closer to gaming area

---

## Expected Results

With all optimizations:
- **Local play:** 40-70ms (responsive for most games)
- **Remote play:** 80-150ms (depends on internet)

**Realistic expectations:**
- You won't reach PS5 DualSense levels (<10ms)
- Vita's old WiFi is the hard limit
- Focus on getting <80ms for good experience

---

## Summary Checklist

- [ ] Disable WiFi Power Save Mode on Vita
- [ ] Router set to WPA2-AES only (no TKIP)
- [ ] Select uncongested WiFi channel
- [ ] PS5 on Ethernet (not WiFi)
- [ ] Vita within 5 meters of router
- [ ] Enable QoS for gaming traffic
- [ ] Test latency with rhythm game

**With all optimizations, you should see 30-50ms improvement over default settings!**
