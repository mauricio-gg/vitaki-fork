- ⚠️ Video Smoothing: Stub

**3. Network Settings (Orange) - STUBS**
- ⚠️ Connection Type: Stub

### Lines of Code
- Components: ~140 lines
- Settings Screen: ~330 lines

- Console count from registered hosts
- Status based on connection state

### Stubs
- ⚠️ PSN ID editing: Display only
- ⚠️ Latency display: Need stream stats integration

### Lines of Code: ~210 lines
