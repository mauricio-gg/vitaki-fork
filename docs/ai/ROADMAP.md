# VitaRPS5 UI Migration Roadmap

## Project Goal
Transform vitaki-fork's basic UI into vitarps5's professional PlayStation-inspired interface while preserving the working streaming functionality.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: UI Framework Migration (Foundation) - CURRENT PHASE
**Goal**: Replace basic UI infrastructure with modern modular system

#### Subphase 1.1: Documentation & Analysis ✅
- [x] Analyze vitaki-fork current architecture
- [x] Analyze vitarps5 modern UI system
- [x] Document migration strategy
- [x] Create development roadmap

#### Subphase 1.2: Framework Foundation - IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Set up modern UI module structure in vita/src/ui/
- [ ] Copy core UI framework files from vitarps5
- [ ] Update build system for new modular architecture
- [ ] Backup original UI implementation

#### Subphase 1.3: Asset Integration
- [ ] Copy modern asset system from vitarps5
- [ ] Update asset loading for new textures and icons
- [ ] Integrate PlayStation symbol particles
- [ ] Test asset loading and rendering

#### Subphase 1.4: Core UI Replacement
- [ ] Replace vita/include/ui.h with modern architecture
- [ ] Update main.c to use new UI system
- [ ] Implement basic modern rendering loop
- [ ] Test basic UI compilation and display

### Phase 2: Navigation System Upgrade
**Goal**: Replace header buttons with wave navigation sidebar

#### Subphase 2.1: Wave Navigation Implementation
- [ ] Implement PlayStation symbol particle system
- [ ] Add wave-based sidebar navigation
- [ ] Create smooth state transitions
- [ ] Add touch navigation support

#### Subphase 2.2: Modern Console Dashboard
- [ ] Replace basic host tiles with modern console cards
- [ ] Add console status indicators (available/connecting/unavailable)
- [ ] Implement touch-optimized grid layout
- [ ] Add console management interactions

### Phase 3: Settings & Features Integration
**Goal**: Replace simple forms with tabbed modern interface

#### Subphase 3.1: Tabbed Settings Interface
- [ ] Implement 4-tab settings system (Streaming/Video/Network/Controller)
- [ ] Create modern UI components (toggles, dropdowns, sliders)
- [ ] Add real-time settings updates
- [ ] Migrate existing settings to new interface

#### Subphase 3.2: Enhanced Registration Flow
- [ ] Integrate modern console pairing workflow
- [ ] Add visual feedback and progress indicators
- [ ] Implement profile management features
- [ ] Add PSN integration capabilities

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
**Goal**: Ensure all functionality works seamlessly

#### Subphase 4.1: Core Functionality Integration
- [ ] Verify streaming integration with new UI
- [ ] Test discovery and registration features
- [ ] Validate controller input and touch navigation
- [ ] Ensure configuration persistence

#### Subphase 4.2: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize rendering for 60fps target
- [ ] Minimize memory usage for PS Vita constraints
- [ ] Maintain sub-50ms streaming latency
- [ ] Test extended play sessions

#### Subphase 4.3: Final Polish
- [ ] Code review and cleanup
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] User experience testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Current Status
- **Active Phase**: Phase 2 Complete - Modern UI Screens Implemented ✅
- **Latest Version**: v0.1.77
- **Next Phase**: Phase 3 - Settings & Features Integration (Backend Wiring)

## Success Criteria
1. **Visual Transformation**: vitaki-fork displays vitarps5's modern interface
2. **Functionality Preservation**: All streaming features continue working
3. **Performance Maintenance**: Smooth UI with maintained streaming performance
4. **Code Quality**: Clean modular structure following project standards

## Technical Milestones
- [ ] Modern UI compiles without errors
- [ ] Basic navigation between UI states works
- [ ] Console discovery integrates with new dashboard
- [ ] Settings changes persist correctly
- [ ] Streaming launches from new interface
- [ ] Touch and controller input both work
- [ ] Performance meets latency requirements

## Risk Mitigation
- Working on separate branch with original UI preserved
- Incremental testing at each phase
- Performance monitoring throughout migration
- Asset validation for PS Vita compatibility
