# Archived Approaches

## Path A: VitaRPS5 Full Integration Attempt (Archived 2025-09-30)

### What Was Attempted
Tried to integrate VitaRPS5's modern UI by importing the entire VitaRPS5 codebase (90+ files including UI and complete backend).

### Why It Was Abandoned
1. **VitaRPS5 UI is tightly coupled to VitaRPS5 backend** - Cannot separate cleanly
2. **User confirmed VitaRPS5 backend is broken** - vitaki-fork backend works
3. **Too much code to bridge** - Would require 10,951 lines of UI modifications + complex stub layer
4. **Better approach exists** - Rebuild vitaki UI (1,212 lines) with VitaRPS5 styling

### Commits Preserved
- `b209d7c` - Initial VitaRPS5 UI integration attempt
- `3e8cbc1` - Added all VitaRPS5 backend modules
- `78236b1` - Documentation of architectural reality

### Files to Clean Up
All VitaRPS5 modules copied to vita/src/:
- core/ (7 files)
- ui/ (12 files)
- utils/ (7 files)
- audio/ (1 file)
- system/ (1 file)
- discovery/ (2 files)
- network/ (8 files)
- console/ (1 file)
- chiaki/ (27 files)

### Lessons Learned
1. Always analyze UI/backend coupling before attempting integration
2. Smaller UI codebases are easier to enhance than large UIs to bridge
3. Visual styling can be separated from logic - just copy rendering helpers
4. Working backends are more valuable than fancy UIs

### New Approach (Path B) - Superseded
**Goal:** Enhance vitaki-fork's working UI (1,212 lines) with VitaRPS5's visual style

**What Was Delivered:** (v0.1.51-54)
1. Rendering helpers (rounded rects, shadows, circles)
2. PlayStation color scheme
3. Modern styling on existing vitaki layout
4. 4 builds completed successfully

**Why Superseded:**
User clarified they want **complete VitaRPS5 UI layout**, not just visual styling:
- Wave navigation sidebar (not just styled header bar)
- Animated PlayStation symbol background (not just charcoal color)
- Console cards (not just styled host tiles)
- Full touch screen interactions

Path B delivered **polish** but not the **full UI redesign** needed.

## Path B: Partial Styling Implementation (Archived 2025-09-30)

### What Was Accomplished
Applied VitaRPS5 visual styling to vitaki's existing UI layout (v0.1.51-54).

**Delivered:**
- 3 rendering helper functions
- PlayStation color scheme
- Rounded corners and shadows on UI elements
- Modern text hierarchy

**Why Insufficient:**
- Kept vitaki's old layout (header bar with buttons, host tiles)
- Needed complete VitaRPS5 layout (wave sidebar, console cards, particles)
- Was styling enhancement, not full UI redesign

See `DONE.md` for full details of Path B work.

## Current Approach: Full VitaRPS5 UI Implementation

**Goal:** Complete VitaRPS5 UI experience with vitaki backend

**Components:**
1. Wave navigation sidebar (130px left)
2. Animated PlayStation symbol background
3. Console cards (400x200) in center
4. Touch screen interactions
5. Discovery and action buttons
