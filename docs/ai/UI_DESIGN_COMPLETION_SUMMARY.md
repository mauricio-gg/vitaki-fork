### Asset Requirements Documented
- Wave navigation PNGs (top/bottom layers)
- PlayStation symbol particles (triangle, circle, X, square)
- Status ellipses (red, green, yellow)
- UI controls (toggles, dropdowns, buttons)
- Console and branding assets

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **vita2d over ImGui** for hardware-accelerated animations
- **Particle system** for PlayStation branding integration
- **Card-based layout** for modern, professional appearance
- **Touch + button controls** for accessibility and user preference

### User Experience
- **Intuitive navigation** with clear visual hierarchy
- **Color-coded sections** for quick identification
- **Responsive feedback** for all interactions
- **Accessibility support** with multiple input methods

### Performance Considerations
- **60fps target** for smooth animations
- **<30MB memory** usage for UI system
- **Optimized particle count** (12 particles for performance)
- **Efficient asset loading** and texture management
