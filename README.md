---

This is a fork built on top of [@ywnico](https://github.com/ywnico)'s excellent [vitaki-fork](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork), which itself is based on [@AAGaming00](https://github.com/AAGaming00)'s [Vitaki](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/chiaki).

**Credit where it's due:** ywnico did the vast majority of the hard work, implementing audio, controls, external network support, wakeup functionality, and numerous critical fixes. AAGaming did the foundational work of porting Chiaki to PS Vita. This fork simply adds UI enhancements and quality-of-life improvements on top of their solid foundation.

## Support This Project

This fork has been a labor of love for the PS Vita community, developed over 3+ months across several design iterations (we even had to start over at one point!). If you enjoy the UI enhancements and improvements, consider buying me a coffee to support continued development. More enhancements are coming!

## What's New in This Fork

This fork adds the following enhancements to ywnico's vitaki-fork:

1. **VitaRPS5-Style UI Redesign**
   - Modern card-based console selection interface
   - Professional PlayStation-themed color scheme
   - Redesigned PIN entry screen with individual digit display
   - Improved visual feedback and animations

2. **Enhanced Console Wake Flow**
   - "Waking up console..." screen with animated progress
   - 30-second timeout with visual countdown
   - Automatic streaming start when console wakes up
   - No need to press X twice

3. **Fixed Controller Input Issues**
   - Resolved race condition that prevented controller input during streaming
   - Properly separated UI and input thread buffer access
   - Controllers now work reliably during remote play

4. **Improved Console Management**
   - Re-pairing now properly deletes registration data from storage
   - Better console name and IP display formatting
   - Circle button for cancel (PlayStation convention)

## Features from ywnico's vitaki-fork

All the features from ywnico's fork are included:
1. Implemented audio
2. Implemented controls
    - Control mappings for L2, R2, L3, R3, and touchpad (trapezoid button), following the official ps4 remote play maps in `vs0:app/NPXS10013/keymap/`. Note that `Select` + `Start` sends the PS (home) button.
    - Motion controls (thanks to [@Epicpkmn11](https://github.com/Epicpkmn11), who also contributed some other controller improvements)
3. Implemented external network remote play (with manually-specified remote IP addresses)
4. Fixed console wakeup
5. Made debug logs visible, added tooltips on some buttons
6. Fixed instant disconnection bug
7. Disabled `vblank_wait` and set fps to 30 to reduce lag.
    - NOTE: the fps in the config file (`chiaki.toml`) will be ignored
8. Merged in updates from chiaki4deck (improved some connection issues)
9. Included [ghost's LiveArea icon fixes](https://git.catvibers.me/aa/chiaki/pulls/13)
10. Many bug and crash fixes

## Building from Source

This project supports two build methods:

### Modern Build System (Recommended - Default)

Uses Docker for consistent, reproducible builds across all platforms. The build script handles all Docker operations automatically.

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker installed and running
- Git (to clone the repository)

**Build Commands:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mauricio-gg/vitaki-fork.git
cd vitaki-fork

# Release build (recommended)
./tools/build.sh

# Debug build (with symbols and verbose logging)
./tools/build.sh debug

# Development shell (for experimentation)
./tools/build.sh shell

# Run test suite
./tools/build.sh test

# Deploy to Vita via FTP
./tools/build.sh deploy <vita_ip>
```

The VPK file will be created in:
- `./build/vitaki-fork.vpk` (main build output)
- `./VitakiForkv0.1.XXX.vpk` (versioned copy in project root)

**Note:** Always use `./tools/build.sh` - never call Docker manually. The script ensures the correct environment and handles versioning automatically.

### Legacy Build System

For compatibility with the original Chiaki build system, you can build using the root CMakeLists.txt:

**Prerequisites:**
- VitaSDK installed and configured
- All Chiaki dependencies installed

**Build Commands:**
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$VITASDK/share/vita.toolchain.cmake \
         -DCHIAKI_ENABLE_VITA=ON \
         -DCHIAKI_ENABLE_GUI=OFF \
         -DCHIAKI_ENABLE_CLI=OFF
make
```

**Note:** The modern build system (Docker) is recommended as it handles all dependencies automatically.

### Creating Releases

This project uses a GitHub Actions workflow to create releases. **Releases can only be created from the `main` branch.**

**To create a new release:**

1. Go to the **Actions** tab on GitHub
2. Select **"Create Release"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Choose the version bump type:
   - **patch** (0.0.X) - Bug fixes, small changes
   - **minor** (0.X.0) - New features, non-breaking changes
   - **major** (X.0.0) - Breaking changes, major updates
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

**The workflow will automatically:**
- Calculate the new version number from the latest tag
- Build the VPK using Docker
- Generate a changelog from merged PRs and commits
- Create and push a git tag
- Create a GitHub release with the VPK attached
- Include installation instructions and changelog

**Example:** If the latest tag is `v1.2.3` and you select `minor`, the new version will be `v1.3.0`.

**Note:** The `main` branch should be protected to ensure releases are created only through approved PRs.

## Instructions
### Local connection
1. Connect PS Vita and PS5 (or PS4) to the same local WiFi network.
2. Log in to the same PSN account on both the PS5 and the Vita.
3. Open Vitaki on PS Vita.
4. Check settings (gear icon) to ensure your encoded PSN ID is there (if it's not automatically populated, or you accidentally deleted it, press START to re-detect it).
5. The console should be automatically detected and appear as an icon.
6. Select the console and Vitaki should ask for a registration code. On the PS5, navigate to `Settings > System > Remote Play` and select `Pair Device`. An 8-digit numeric code should appear; enter this into Vitaki and hit triangle to save.
7. Select the console again in Vitaki. It should now connect (and in the future, will not ask for the device pairing code).

### Remote connection
UDP holepunching is not supported. Instead, a remote connection requires a static IP and port forwarding.

1. Register your console on your local network following the above instructions.
2. Follow the "manual remote connection" section in [these instructions](https://streetpea.github.io/chiaki-ng/setup/remoteconnection/#manual-remote-connection) to set up a static IP and port forwarding on your network.
3. Select the `add remote host` button (the leftmost button in the toolbar) in Vitaki. Enter the remote IP address and the registered console.

If you are on the local network, your console will be discovered locally and a separate tile for remote connection will not be shown. If you want to test on the local network, turn off discovery (wifi icon in the toolbar).

Currently, Vitaki cannot detect the status of remote hosts. Therefore, when selecting one, it will both send the wakeup signal and immediately try to start remote play. If the console was asleep, then this first attempt at remote play will fail, so try again in 10 or 15 seconds.

Note: if the remote host cannot be reached, it will get stuck on "Trying to request session" for 90 seconds and then time out. If the remote host was reachable but asleep, "Trying to request session" should fail after just a few seconds.

## Config settings
Some configuration lacks a UI but can be set in the config file located at `ux0:data/vita-chiaki/chiaki.toml`.
- `circle_btn_confirm = true` swaps circle and cross in the main UI, so that circle is confirm and cross is cancel (`false` makes cross into confirm and circle into cancel). Note that this does not affect the button mappings in remote play, only in the UI before remote play starts.
- `auto_discovery = false` makes Vitaki not start discovery on launch. It can still be started manually by selecting the wifi icon.

## Known issues & troubleshooting
- Latency. On remote connections (not local WLAN), it's especially bad. ([Relevant GitHub issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues/12))
- Vitaki may crash with error C2-12828-1 if incompatible plugins such as reRescaler are installed. Thanks to [@GuillermoAVeces](https://github.com/GuillermoAVeces) for identifying this. ([Relevant issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues/1)).
- Typically only one stream works per launch. If the screen becomes gray and unresponsive, restart Vitaki. ([Relevant issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues/16))
- In the past crashes occurred when multiple consoles are on the network, but this has likely been fixed. ([Relevant issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues/6)).

If problems arise:
- Try restarting Vitaki first.
- Then, try deleting/renaming the config file (`ux0:data/vita-chiaki/chiaki.toml`). 
- If that doesn't help, create a new [issue](https://github.com/ywnico/vitaki-fork/issues) (or comment on an existing issue).
